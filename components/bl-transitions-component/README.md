## Usage Guide

### Adding the Transitions component to the page:

<img alt="Add component on page" src="./example-images/add_on_page.jpg" width="900" />

### Adding component in the transitions pod:
> ðŸ”´ **IMPORTANT**: If you add any Image component, set its width and height. This is generally good practice for all images on a website

<img alt="Add component in transitions" src="./example-images/add_component_in_transitions.jpg" width="900" />

Now you can open the preview and see the mount animation when the page loads.

---

### Changing the visibility of the component Transitions

You can also change the visibility of the component "Transitions" and see the animation for mounting and unmounting.

For example:

1. Add two buttons to the page: the first button is "Open" and the second button is "Close":

<img alt="Add open and close button" src="./example-images/add_open_close_button.jpg" width="900" />

2. Open button logic:

<img alt="Open button logic" src="./example-images/open_button_logic.jpg" width="900" />

3. Close button logic:

<img alt="Close button logic" src="./example-images/close_button_logic.jpg" width="900" />

In the preview, you now have the option to change the visibility of the component with animation by clicking on either the Close or Open button.

### Adding component with dynamic content in transition
If you want to animate content that is rendered with a delay (for example, asynchronously loaded) follow the guide:

1. You need to activate it in the settings:

> ðŸ”´ **IMPORTANT**: After this action the component will not be displayed in preview mode

<img alt="Close button logic" src="example-images/enable_dynamic_content.jpg" />

2. Run the action `Set Content Loaded` when your components are fully rendered. It could be done in `On ... Mount` handlers.

<img alt="Close button logic" src="example-images/add_setContentLoaded_in_onLoadEvent.jpg" width="900" />
